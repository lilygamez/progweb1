        It's hard for me to say the things<br>
I want to say sometimes<br>
There's no one here but you and me<br>
And that broken old street light<br>
Lock the doors<br>
We'll leave the world outside<br>
All I've got to give to you<br>
Are these five words when I<br>
Thank you for loving me<br>
For being my eyes<br>
When I couldn't see<br>
For parting my lips<br>
When I couldn't breathe<br>
Thank you for loving me<br>
Thank you for loving me<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        I never knew I had a dream<br>
Until that dream was you<br>
When I look into your eyes<br>
The sky's a different blue<br>
Cross my heart<br>
I wear no disguise<br>
If I tried, you'd make believe<br>
That you believed my lies<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Thank you for loving me<br>
For being my eyes<br>
When I couldn't see<br>
For parting my lips<br>
When I couldn't breathe<br>
Thank you for loving me
    </p>
    <p>
        You pick me up when I fall down<br>
You ring the bell before they count me out<br>
If I was drowning you would part the sea<br>
And risk your own life to rescue me
    </p>
    <p>
        Lock the doors<br>
We'll leave the world outside<br>
All I've got to give to you<br>
Are these five words when I
    </p>
    <p>
        Thank you for loving me<br>
For being my eyes<br>
When I couldn't see<br>
You parted my lips<br>
When I couldn't breathe<br>
Thank you for loving me
    </p>
    <p>
        When I couldn't fly<br>
Oh, you gave me wings<br>
You parted my lips<br>
When I couldn't breathe<br>
Thank you for loving me<br>
Thank you for loving me<br>
Thank you for loving me<br>
Oh, for loving me
    </p>
